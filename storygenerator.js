    "<span class='mentor'>MENTOR</span> and his horse <span class='herald'>HERALD</span> get lost in the <span class='setting2'>forest</span> while traveling to a fair to present his wood-chopping <span class='noun2'>machine</span>. After being chased by a pack of wolves, he comes across <span class='lover'>LOVER</span>'s castle. Inside, he <span class='verb2'>meets</span> <span class='friend'>FRIEND</span> the candlestick, <span class='guardian'>GUARDIAN</span> the clock, and <span class='trickster'>TRICKSTER</span> the teacup. However, <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> quickly discovers and detains <span class='mentor'>MENTOR</span>. After <span class='herald'>HERALD</span> leads <span class='hero'>HERO</span> to <span class='lover'>LOVER</span>'s castle, she offers to take her father's place. Over her father's objections, <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> accepts <span class='hero'>HERO</span>'s offer. <span class='proseSubject2'></span><span class='proseAction2'></span><span class='proseObject2'></span> While <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> sulks over <span class='hero'>HERO</span>'s rejection, <span class='mentor'>MENTOR</span> returns to town but is unable to convince the others to save <span class='hero'>HERO</span> from <span class='lover'>LOVER</span>.</p>",
    "Finally, <span class='hero'>HERO</span> rebels and leaves, making her way into <span class='setting2'>town</span>. There she <span class='verb2'>watches</span> the act of another street entertainer, <span class='lover'>LOVER</span>, a talented high wire artist and <span class='noun2'>clown</span>. When <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> finds <span class='hero'>HERO</span> there, he forcibly takes her back. They join a ragtag travelling circus where <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> already works. <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> teases <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> at every opportunity, though he cannot explain what motivates him to do so. After <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> drenches <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> with a pail of water, <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> chases after his tormentor with his knife drawn. As a result, <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> is briefly jailed. <span class='proseSubject2'></span><span class='proseAction2'></span><span class='proseObject2'></span> Eventually, <span class='goon'>GOON</span> fires both <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> and <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> from the travelling circus.</p>",
    "Unable to communicate with <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span>, <span class='hero'>HERO</span> and <span class='friend'>FRIEND</span> visit <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> with a note asking to be taken to the <span class='noun2'>piano</span>. <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> <span class='verb2'>explains</span> that he cannot read. When <span class='friend'>FRIEND</span> translates her mother's wishes, <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> initially refuses, but the three ultimately spend the day on the <span class='setting2'>beach</span> with <span class='hero'>HERO</span> playing music. <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> is taken by the transformation in <span class='hero'>HERO</span> when she plays her piano. <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> suggests that <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> trade the instrument to him for some land. <span class='proseSubject2'></span><span class='proseAction2'></span><span class='proseObject2'></span> <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> consents, and agrees to his further request to receive lessons from <span class='hero'>HERO</span>, oblivious to <span class='lover'>LOVER</span>'s attraction to her. <span class='hero'>HERO</span> complains that she doesn't want an illiterate man with filthy hands touching her piano. <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> demands that she fulfill the contract. On the day she arrives at <span class='lover'>LOVER</span>'s hut, she is stunned to find that <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> has perfectly tuned the piano. <span class='lover'>LOVER</span> proposes that <span class='hero'>HERO</span> can earn her piano back at a rate of one piano key per 'lesson,' provided that he can observe her and do what he wants while she plays. She agrees, but negotiates for a number of lessons equal to the number of black keys only.</p>",

He believes this to be a result of the teleportation process 'purifying' his body. <span class='hero'>HERO</span>, however, is more concerned about <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span>'s growing mania, as well as the strange, bristly hairs growing out of a previously sustained wound in his back. <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> quickly becomes arrogant and violent, insisting that the teleportation process is like a beneficial drug, and tries to force <span class='hero'>HERO</span> to undergo teleportation. When she <span class='verb3'>refuses</span>, he abandons her to indulge in a barroom armwrestling match, which leaves his opponent, <span class=goon>GOON</span>, with a compound fracture, and casual sex with a woman named <span class='trickster'>TRICKSTER</span>, whom he picks up at the <span class='setting3'>bar</span>. <span class='hero'>HERO</span>'s next-morning arrival at the lab spares <span class='trickster'>TRICKSTER</span> from being forcibly teleported by <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span>.

He eventually reaches out to <span class='hero'>HERO</span>, and theorizes that he is slowly becoming a hybrid creature that is neither human nor insect. <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> soon starts to exhibit fly-like characteristics, such as vomiting digestive enzymes onto his food in order to dissolve it, and the ability to cling to walls and ceilings. He also realizes that he is losing his human reason and compassion, and that he is now being driven by primitive impulses he cannot control. <span class='proseSubject4'></span><span class='proseAction4'></span><span class='proseObject4'></span> Attempting to find a <span class='noun4'>cure</span> for his condition, <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> <span class='verb4'>installs</span> a fusion program into the Telepod computer in order to dilute the fly genes in his body with pure human DNA. To her horror, <span class='hero'>HERO</span> learns that she is pregnant by <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span>, and cannot be sure if the child was conceived before or after his fateful teleportation. After she has a nightmare of giving birth to a giant maggot, a terrified <span class='hero'>HERO</span> has <span class='mentor'>MENTOR</span> persuade a reluctant doctor to perform an abortion in the middle of the <span class='setting4'>night</span>. However, having learned of the pregnancy, <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span> abducts <span class='hero'>HERO</span> before the abortion can be carried out, and begs her to carry the child to term, since it could potentially be the last remnant of his untainted humanity. <span class='hero'>HERO</span> sadly refuses, afraid that the child will be a hideous mutant. Meanwhile, <span class='mentor'>MENTOR</span> breaks into <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span>'s lab with a shotgun and comes to <span class='hero'>HERO</span>'s rescue, but is seriously injured and nearly killed by the almost fully transformed <span class='shadow'>SHADOW</span>, who dissolves <span class='mentor'>MENTOR</span>'s left hand and right ankle with his corrosive vomit-drop enzyme. <span class='mentor'>MENTOR</span> is only spared due to <span class='hero'>HERO</span>’s pleas.",
